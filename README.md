Time series Weather Forecasting using Facebook prophet

Weather forecasting is an application of Time Series Forecasting where we use time-series data and algorithms to make forecasts for a given time.
Weather forecasting is the task of forecasting weather conditions for a given location and time. With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days.

For forecasting weather using PythonD dataset taken from Kaggle based on the Daily weather data of New Delhi. We can use this dataset for the task of weather forecasting.

Task of weather forecasting. This is done using the Facebook prophet model for this task. The Facebook prophet model is one of the best techniques for time series forecasting. If you have never used this model before, you can install it on your system by using the command mentioned below in your command prompt or terminal: 

pip install prophet

The prophet model accepts time data named as “ds”, and labels as “y”. So let’s convert the data into this format:

So by this technique we can perform wweather forecasting over period of days and date

Conclusion:
Weather forecasting is the task of forecasting weather conditions for a given location and time. With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days.
